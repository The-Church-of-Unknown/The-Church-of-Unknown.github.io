<p>The Church of Unknown</p>

<p>Members of The Church of Unknown (Tchou) want to get the benefits that some Christians enjoy, while not needing to believe in a God.</p>

<p>Membership is non-exclusive: Members can, and perhaps might be encouraged to, be practicing members of other religions. At least one Member is, in some sense, a practicing Christian.</p>

<p>If, for whatever reason, you want to interact with a Member, then please feel free to send a communication.</p>
